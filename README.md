[![Github All Releases](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/fbernaudo22/IMGQuizBuilder/total.svg)]()

MoleScan is a project to let the user have a first idea of the status of a mole.
This is still a project under construction and actually don't give the user a correct result. This is due to the unavailability of a big dataset of benign and malign moles.

## How it works

The project, throught a Machine Learning model should understand if a mole is PROBABLY benign or malign.
ATTENTION: This model actually doesn't work, it has been built for training purposes, so the model actually DOESN'T WORK.
